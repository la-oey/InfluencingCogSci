##Author network data
#Some authors are not connected to the main part of the network. This happens when they have one publication/other reasons. This is bad for measuring certain kinds of centrality because they depend on paths and loops through the network. Taking the most published authors is expedient, but a more sophisticated means should be considered.  Additionally our graph is not simple because there are multiple connections between authors, if we select unique connections the network will be more amenable (including the removeDuplicates function in getEdges will do this). 

#includes all authors
author_net = byAuthor %>% select(title,authorAbbr,year) %>% unique()
author_net

#removes authors with <n publications
# n.pubs=5
# author_net = author_net %>% 
#   group_by(author) %>% 
#   summarise(count = n()) %>% 
#   filter(count<n.pubs) %>% 
#   anti_join(author_net,.)

#histogram of number of publications
# author_net %>% 
#   group_by(authorAbbr) %>% 
#   summarise(count = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(x=reorder(authorAbbr,count),y=count)) + geom_boxplot(stat = 'identity')
